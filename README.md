The proposed methodology consists of two distinct steps: (1) preprocessing a DEM to establish the nested hierarchy of depressions and the sequence of filling-spilling-merging and (2) generating the DEM-graph and executing the GB-RFSM. In this study, an ArcGIS Python toolkit is developed to perform the first step, and a Python program is presented for the GB-RFSM implementation. The suggested framework and the connection between the two processes are depicted in this figure.

STEP1:

ArcGID Python toolbox:

Functions.py & DEM2G.pyt

 

STEP2:

RFSMtoolsV3.py
